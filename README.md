# Machine Learning Models for Restaurant Revenue and University Admissions

This repository contains two machine learning projects implemented using Jupyter Notebooks. The projects demonstrate the application of linear regression and logistic regression.

## Projects Overview

1. **Restaurant Revenue Prediction (`RestaurantLinearRegression.ipynb`)**  
   - **Objective:** Predict the revenue of a restaurant based on various features.  
   - **Model:** Linear Regression.  
   - **Dataset:** Includes features such as location, customer ratings, and operational details.

2. **University Admission Prediction (`UniversityLogisticRegression.ipynb`)**  
   - **Objective:** Predict whether a student will be admitted to a university based on their profile.  
   - **Model:** Logistic Regression.  
   - **Dataset:** Includes features such as GRE scores, GPA, and university ranking.

## Repository Structure

```
RestaurantLinearRegression.ipynb    # Jupyter Notebook for restaurant revenue prediction
UniversityLogisticRegression.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for university admission prediction
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or above
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-projects.git
   cd ml-projects
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the desired notebook (`RestaurantLinearRegression.ipynb` or `UniversityLogisticRegression.ipynb`) in your browser.

## Usage

- **Restaurant Revenue Prediction:**
  1. Open `RestaurantLinearRegression.ipynb`.
  2. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, train the model, and evaluate performance.

- **University Admission Prediction:**
  1. Open `UniversityLogisticRegression.ipynb`.
  2. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, train the model, and analyze results.

## Results

- The Linear Regression model predicts restaurant revenue based on various operational and demographic features.
- The Logistic Regression model predicts the likelihood of university admission based on student data.
